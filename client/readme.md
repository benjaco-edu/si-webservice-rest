Objective:

- SOAP webservice is made with C-sharp
- REST webservice is made with Nodejs
- Client is made in python (version 3.6.5)


Without docker:
Requirement: Python3 must be installed on your pc
Run the application from your chosen folder
Type "python WebserviceClient.py"

You will be presented with the following options:

You will have to select:
- 1 for SOAP (teachers)
- 2 fo REST (students)

The following procedure is self-explanatory

Both choices will give you 5 options to choose:
- 1 Get all list of (SOAP) teachers or (REST) students 
- 2 Get a given teacher/student by typing ID
- 3 Add a new teacher/student to the list
- 4 Update a teacher/student in the list 
- 5 Delete a teacher/student from the list

* if you are forced back to "main terminal" you have to (once again) start by selecting 1 for SOAP or 2 for REST, 
otherwise the program will give an error.
